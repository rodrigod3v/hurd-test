## 🐞 Key Findings

### 1. [CRITICAL] Main Thread Fatal Exceptions
- **Issue**: Repeated application crashes detected via `adb logcat`.
- **Evidence**: `evidence/errors.log` contains detailed stack traces for `FATAL EXCEPTION: main`.

### 2. [MAJOR] Learning Content - Infinite Loading
- **Issue**: The "Learn" module fails to fetch content, resulting in a persistent UI spinner.
- **Evidence**: Verified across multiple fresh launches; technical details in `evidence/hierarchy.json` show the spinner component is active but no content items are rendered.

### 3. [MAJOR] Component Interaction Failure
- **Issue**: Navigation back-buttons on specific sub-flows (Contribute) are non-responsive to digital taps.
- **Evidence**: Hierarchy analysis shows the component is present but hit-rects appear misaligned or obscured.
